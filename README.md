# Jonathan Whiteley's R library

Miscellaneous useful R code, including example scripts, templates, and functions I find myself using a lot.
This is still a work in progress: a lot of it is material I dug out of my PhD, with a few pieces updated from more current work.

I have written most of the contents myself, except for everything in `/examples_`, which is all from other people and copied for reference (see the code for sources).

Some functions in `/functions` are from other people: the source should be in the comments to the code.

Fork, copy, share, and feel free to send me comments!
